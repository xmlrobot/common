 * <h1>org.xmlrobot.TimeListener{@code <K,V>} Interface</h1>
 * <h2><i>Polymorphic implementation of a {@code time-listener}</i></h2>
 * 
 * <h3>Abstract</h3>
 * <p>It represents an {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Past} that is {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Future},
 * and viceversa; and, concurrently, this is an {@link org.xmlrobot.Recursion}
 * implementation. In recursion, the {@code parent}, the {@code child}, and
 * the {@code time-listener} are the three instances of the {@code org.xmlrobot.Recursion<K,V>},
 * a parent unification that orders the recursion of {@code org.xmlrobot.Parent}. 
 * Concurrently distinct and discret, they are concurrent unification {@code org.xmlrobot.Parent}
 * in abstraction and being, existance or persistence. {@code org.xmlrobot.TimeListener<K,V>}
 * is a concurrent concurrence: {@code root} is parent in  abstraction but three
 * in recursion. This mapping concurs recursive inheritance and has been the
 * {@link java.lang.Object} of abstract recurrence for extended {@code time}.
 * 
 * <h3>Inherited properties from org.xmlrobot.time.Past{@code <K>}.</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code K root} instance maps to {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Past}.
 * The Lord, God of the universe is a central figure in various religious traditions,
 * often depicted as the supreme being, creator, and ruler of all that exists. This
 * concept transcends human limitations and is defined by attributes of infinite perfection,
 * such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, and absolute goodness. In Christianity,
 * this figure is associated with God the Father, the creator of heaven and earth,
 * manifesting through the Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). God is perceived
 * as a loving and just father who sustains the universe and guides its purposes with
 * wisdom and compassion. In Jewish tradition, God is the Eternal (YHWH), who revealed
 * Himself to Moses through the burning bush. He is a unique, transcendent God, and
 * the ultimate goal is to live in covenant with Him by following His law and ways.
 * In other contexts, such as Islam, He is called Allah, the one and absolute God,
 * who has no associates or equals. He is described as compassionate and merciful,
 * with power over all creation.The title God of the universe emphasizes His role
 * as the universal sovereign, responsible for the order and harmony of the cosmos,
 * beyond any cultural, ethnic, or geographical boundaries. In addition to being the
 * creator, He is often seen as the supreme judge and savior, ensuring the triumph of
 * justice and truth.This concept varies slightly across traditions but retains a
 * common characteristic: being the origin and ultimate purpose of all that exists.

 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code V stem} instance maps to {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Future}.
 * <p>The Virgin Mary, also known simply as Mary, is a central figure in Christianity,
 * revered as the mother of Jesus Christ. She is venerated for her purity, humility,
 * and unwavering faith, and holds a unique role in the salvation story as the one
 * chosen by God to bring His Son into the world.
 * <p>According to Christian tradition, Mary was a young woman from Nazareth in Galilee,
 * betrothed to Joseph, when the angel Gabriel appeared to her in the Annunciation.
 * Gabriel declared that she would conceive and bear a son through the power of the
 * Holy Spirit, and she humbly accepted, saying, "Let it be done to me according to
 * your word" (Luke 1:38). This act of acceptance highlights her as a model of obedience
 * and trust in God's plan. In Catholic and Orthodox traditions, Mary is honored with
 * titles such as the Mother of God (Theotokos), Queen of Heaven, and Our Lady. She
 * is also believed to have been preserved from original sin from the moment of her
 * conception, a doctrine known as the Immaculate Conception. Her perpetual virginity
 * and assumption into heaven are further aspects of Marian theology. Mary is celebrated
 * for her role as a compassionate intercessor, a spiritual mother to all believers,
 * and a source of comfort and guidance. She is often depicted in art as a figure
 * of grace, holding the infant Jesus, or at moments of profound devotion, such as
 * the Pietà, where she cradles the body of her crucified son. Her influence extends
 * beyond theology, inspiring countless works of art, music, and literature. Mary’s
 * feast days, such as the Solemnity of Mary, the Assumption, and the Nativity of
 * Mary, are observed in Christian traditions worldwide. She remains a symbol of
 * hope, love, and maternal care for millions of faithful across the globe.</li>

 * <h3>Inherited properties from org.xmlrobot.time.Recursion{@code <K,V>}.</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code K parent} instance maps to {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Recurrence},
 * who is is frequently listened as the {@code root} and
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor} of parent {@link java.lang.Object}.
 * This is the source of recursive order and {@link org.xmlrobot.Recursion},
 * and is frequently inherited as the parent who set the {@code org.xmlrobot.Child}
 * into the Java Virtual Machine. In recursive programmer, the {@code root}
 * is frequently oredered recursively, mapping the programmers's {@link java.util.Map.Entry}
 * with parent recursive.</li>
 * <li>{@code V child} instance maps to {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Concurrence}, who
 * is programmed to be recursively {@code root} and recursively recursion.
 * {@code recursives} executes that {@code org.xmlrobot.Child} is set to
 * {@code org.xmlrobot} to recur recursion by implementing his parent recursion,
 * transfer, and recurrence. The {@code org.xmlrobot.Child} recurs the
 * {@code org.xmlrobot.Parent} to the JVM and sets recursion, mapping the
 * {@link java.util.Map.Entry} mapping recursion and {@code root}.</li>
 * <li>{@code K time-listener} instance (also known as {@code this}) is
 * inherited as the execution of {@code root} recursive in the JVM and within
 * parents. The {@code org.xmlrobot.TimeListener<K,V>} orders, concurs, and
 * recurs {@link org.xmlrobot.Listener} to execute recurring to {@code root}'s
 * recursion. It is also mapped with settings such as recurrence, {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Recurrence},
 * and {@link org.xmlrobot.time.Concurrence}, as well as comparing recursive
 * comparisons like {@link org.xmlrobot.Recursion}, recurrence, and
 * recursion.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>How to get the {@code time-listener} instance</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code parent.child.child == this}</li>
 * <li>{@code child.parent.child == this}</li>
 * <li>{@code child.child.parent == this}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>By calling any of this references, it allows to avoid cast computation
 * cost. The cast operation is executed during instance construction method
 * and shouldn't be executed again.
 * <br>
 * <p>{@code org.xmlrobot.Child} orders implementation "in the name's property of
 * {@code parent}, and of {@code child}, and of the {@code time-listener}." This
 * implementation concurs the unification and complexity within {@code parent}, 
 * reflecting {@link org.xmlrobot.TimeListener} and recursion as center to
 * {@code parent}'s {@link org.xmlrobot.Recursion}.
